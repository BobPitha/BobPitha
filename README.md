# Hi!! I'm @BobPitha
**...who are you?** Leave me a message if you like.

I'm a human who works as a software engineer. I studied chemistry when I was in school (so, so long ago!).
For a while I worked on developing chemistry-related software (molecular modeling, chemical graphics, and computational drug design).
Since 2005 I've been mostly working in robotics. I've been lucky to have had some brilliant colleagues and worked in some very interesting places.

I'm interested in everything. OK, at least everything interesting. I started out programming in Fortran on VAX/VMS systems. You might not have
heard of them. More recently, I've worked in object-oriented languages like C++, Java, C# and Python. Lately, I'm getting interested in 
Functional Programming languages, specifically Erlang. It's interesting how much of a mental shift is needed.

Lately I've been working the Artificial Intelligence/Data Science group at GreyOrange, a comapny focused on warehouse automation. Yes, I kid you not: 
my group has the unfortunate abbreviation of AI/DS. We stuck the / in so it wasn't as flagranty terrible.

I'm open to any sort of collaboration. Just drop me a note and suggest something. You can reach me at rpitha@gmail.com or bob@pitha.net.
